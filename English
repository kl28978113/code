To whom It May Concern:

My name is Rong Lin. I am a U.S. Permanent Resident
and I reside at 1021 64th st, Brooklyn, NY 11219.
I am writing this letter to invite my parents, Yunlong
Lin and Meijin Yan, to visit me for a period of one
month. My parents have never been to the United States.

The purpose of the visit is for tourism within the United
States. During their visit, they will stay with me at 
the above address. At the conclusion of their visit, I will
see that my parents return safely to China.

My parents will be presenting this letter to you, along
with evidence to establish their close ties to China,
and to assure you that they will return prior to the
expiration of their stay in the United States.

Your kind consideration to this request is greatly
appreciated.

Sincerely, 

Rong Lin
